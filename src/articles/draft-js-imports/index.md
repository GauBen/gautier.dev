title: All possible JavaScript imports
description: There are so many of them, it's definitely confusing. Let's list them all, and see what they do.
snippet:
  lang: js
  code: |
    import React, {useState, useEffect} from 'react';
    import * as React from 'react';
    import React = require('react');
    // ...?
---

<script>
  import {Tldr, Callout} from '$lib/markdown';
</script>

<Tldr>

Here is everything about JavaScript imports. And even more. It's definitely not meant to be read like my other articles, but more as a reference.

</Tldr>

```ts
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import type { JSX } from "react";
import { type JSX } from "react";
import * as React from "react";
import React = require("react");
const React = await import("react");
// ...!
```

And the list can go on longer. If it confuses you, rest assured, you are far from alone. In this article, I'll try to explain both the why and the how of all these import statements.

Take a drink, it _will_ be a long road.

Code samples in this article do not reflect best practices, but are meant to give you an idea of what was done in the past. Please don't take them as gospel.

</Callout>

## Why the mess?

### The origins: `<script>` tags

Let's go back in time and ask ourselves "How did we get here?"

There was a time when JavaScript was a simple, browser-bound, scripting language. Its only purpose was to sprinkle a bit of interactivity âœ¨ on webpages.

```html
<script>
  // Will show an alert if the form is not filled
  function validate() {
    var email = document.getElementsByName("email")[0].value;
    if (email == "") {
      alert("Please fill in both fields");
      return false;
    }
  }
</script>

<form method="POST" action="/register.do">
  <label>Email: <input type="text" name="email" /></label>
  <button onclick="return validate()">Submit</button>
</form>
```

I should have added a [`<table>` layout](https://thehistoryoftheweb.com/tables-layout-absurd/) for nostalgia, but I digress.

Somehow, people got bored of doing the same thing over and over again<sup>[_citation needed_]</sup> and started turning themselves to reusable bits of JavaScript, usually called **libraries**. The most famous one is probably jQuery, born in 2006, but there were a lot of them. ([JS fatigue](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10796567) ain't new, folks.)

How do you include a library in your page? You add a `<script>` tag, and you're done.

```html
<script src="/path/to/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script>
  $("#button").on("click", function () {
    $("#toggle").toggle();
  });
</script>
```

This `$` variable comes from `jquery.min.js`, but how does it work exactly? It leverages the fact that all scripts in a webpage share the same global scope, named `window`. (It means that `$ === window.$`.) In practice, here is what jQuery---and all libs for that matter---does:

```html
<script>
  // jquery.min.js
  (function (window) {
    // Internal utilities
    var internalObject = {};
    function internalFunction() {}

    // Register the `$` variable in the global scope
    window.$ = function (selector) {
      // `internalFunction` and `internalObject` can be accessed here
    };
  })(window);
</script>

<script>
  // Your script only sees the `$` variable
  $("#button").doSomething();
  // window.$ would work too

  // `internalFunction` or `internalObject` are not accessible here
  // because declared in a closure (a function scope)
</script>
```

While this works for basic cases, this mechanism---registering libraries to the global scope---will break down in bigger projects, where you might have several libraries or even several versions of the same library, as some names are reused.

### The rise of modules: Node.js

In 2009, a guy named [Ryan Dahl](https://github.com/ry) thought it was a great idea to run JavaScript outside of the browser and make it a general-purpose programming language. Let's not discuss the sanity of this decision, but it gave birth to Node.js. And no programming language is complete without a package manager (looking at you C ðŸ‘€), so npm was born a year later, in 2010.

Since there are no `<script>` tags in Node.js---you run JS directly, not HTML---you need a way to include other files. **This is where the `require` function comes in.**

`require` is a global Node.js function that has the power to import a relative JS file if it starts with `./` or import from a `node_modules` folder if it doesn't. To abide by the [principle of encapsulation](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(computer_programming)>), Node.js offers a file-scoped `module` variable to declare the exposed API.

Here an example using both `require` and `module.exports`, with both relative and `node_modules` imports:

```js
// ./node_modules/pad-right/index.js
// Expose a function that pads a string with whitespaces
module.exports = function pad(str, len) {
  while (str.length < len) {
    str = str + " ";
  }
  return str;
};

// ./books.js
// Expose an array of books
module.exports = [
  { title: "Journey to the Center of the Earth", year: 1864 },
  { name: "Gilded Needles", year: 1980 },
  { name: "The Housemaid", year: 2022 },
];

// ./index.js
var pad = require("pad-right"); // Import from node_modules
var books = require("./books"); // Relative import

console.log("*** My favorite books ***");
for (var i = 0; i < books.length; i++) {
  console.log(pad(books[i].title, 34), "|", books[i].year);
}
```

This code will print:

```
*** My favorite books ***
Journey to the Center of the Earth | 1864
Gilded Needles                     | 1980
The Housemaid                      | 2022
```

In this example, the `module.exports` variable is set to a function and an array, and that's what is retrieved when `require` is called. While it can be anything, **usage turned to objects to expose multiple functions and values:**

```js
// ./greet.js
// `module.exports` is `{}` by default, properties can be added to it
module.exports.name = "World";
module.exports.sayHello = function (name) {
  console.log("Hello " + name);
};

// ./index.js
var greet = require("./greet"); // `greet` is an object with methods and properties
greet.sayHello(greet.name);
```

This type of modules is called **[CommonJS](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules-commonjs-modules), or CJS for short.** It's the extension that can be used in Node.js to enforce the evaluation of JavaScript file as a CommonJS module.

If you take a second look at the snippets above, you'll notice that the argument of the `require` function does not need an extension. Instead, Node.js uses [a resolution algorithm](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#all-together) that can be summed up as follows: if the extension-less file cannot be found, try concatenating `.js` and `/index.js`.

### More mess: TypeScript

JavaScript's more popular flavor, TypeScript, was created in 2012. It adds static typing to the language, and with it, new ways to import and export modules.

Because types do not exist at runtime, TypeScript had to come up with a way to import and export types only. This syntax is completely erased during the transpilation process. There's no reason to use it nowadays, but I mention it for the sake of completeness.

```ts
// ./book.ts
interface Book {
  title: string;
  year: number;
}
export = Book;

// ./index.ts
import Book = require("./book");
const book: Book = { title: "The Priory of the Orange Tree", year: 2019 };
```

Do not use that, it's a relic of the past.

In case `export =` is used with a value, it will be transpiled to `module.exports =`.

## Standard modules: ES6

In 2015, the 6th version of the ECMAScript specification was released. (It's ECMAScript and not JavaScript [because JavaScript is trademark](https://tinyclouds.org/trademark), but both languages are one and the same.) With it comes an official, standardized way to declare modules, called **ECMAScript modules, or ESM for short**.

This is the `import` and `export` syntax you know and love! Because this standard was meant to supersede all others, it was made powerful enough to handle all cases, especially the ones from CommonJS.

Also, because it is a standard, it is supported by all modern runtimes: browsers, Node.js, Deno, Bun... ESM puts an end to platform-specific module systems.

### Exporting a single value with `export default`

Let's start exploring the `export` syntax with its simplest form: exporting a single value.

```js
// ./greet.js
export default function greet(name) {
  console.log("Hello " + name);
}

// ./index.js
import greet from "./greet.js"; // Notice the `.js` extension!
greet("World");
```

This is the modern version of `module.exports =`. The only thing worth mentioning is that Node's resolution algorithm does not apply to ESM. You need to specify the extension of the file you're importing.

It works with any value, functions, arrays, primitives, and objects. For instance, you can export an object:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
// ./config.js
export default {
  host: "localhost",
  port: 3000,
};

// ./index.js
import config from "./config.js";
console.log("Server running on", config.host + ":" + config.port);
```

It is tempting to write `import { host, port } from "./config.js"`, but it won't work; **you cannot destructure a default export**. While it works to export an object as a default export, ESM offers a better, more explicit way to export multiple values.

### Exporting multiple values with `export`

Let's get back to the config example and export the `host` and `port` values separately:

```js
// ./config.js
export const host = "localhost";
export const port = 3000;

// ./index.js
import { host, port } from "./config.js";
console.log("Server running on", host + ":" + port);
```

`host` and `port` are called **named exports**. The `config.js` file no longer has a default export, but two named exports. The `export` keyword can be used in front of any declaration, or as a standalone statement:

```js
// These two samples are equivalent:
// 1. Prefixing the declaration with `export`
export function greet(name) {
  console.log("Hello " + name);
}

// 2. Using `export` as a standalone statement
function greet(name) {
  console.log("Hello " + name);
}
export { greet };
```

In the same fashion, `export default <value>` can be used as a standalone statement.

The default and named import syntax are not interchangeable. For instance the following code will not work:

```js
// ./config.js
export const host = "localhost";
export const port = 3000;

// ./index.js
import config from "./config.js";
// The requested module './config.js' does not provide an export named 'default'
```

To import all named exports under a single object, you can use the `* as` syntax instead:

```js
// ./index.js
import * as config from "./config.js";
console.log("Server running on", config.host + ":" + config.port);
```

The `import * as` form is called a **namespace import**.

### Mixing default and named exports

So far we only studied default and named exports separately. But what if we want to export both a default value and named values?

```js
// ./config.js
export const host = "localhost";
export const port = 3000;
export default `${host}:${port}`;

// ./index.js
import server, { host, port } from "./config.js";
// You can import the default export and named exports in the same statement
```

It works, **the import statement can import both the default export and the named exports at the same time**; the default export must come first.

It you take a second look at the error that was thrown when trying to import a default export when none was defined, `The requested module does not provide an export named 'default'`, you'll notice that it does not mention a default export, but a named export named `default`.

The `import default` syntax is syntactic sugar for importing an export named `default`! How can we name an export `default` then?

### Exports can be named and renamed

So far we only explored exporting values with their original name. It's a good practice to keep a name consistent across files, for debugging and refactoring purposes, but the standard allows you to rename exports.

```js
// ./jquery.js
// `selectElements` is an internal name
function selectElements(selector) {
  // jQuery magic here ðŸª„âœ¨
}
export { selectElements as $ }; // It's exported as `$`

// ./index.js
import { $ } from "./jquery.js";
$("article").toggle();
```

In this example, the library renames its internal function `selectElements` to `$` when exporting it. This is a common practice in libraries to keep the API consistent across versions, or prepare deprecations:

```js
function newFunction() {
  // I'm a new function!
}

// Allow newFunction to be imported as oldFunction during the transition
export { newFunction, newFunction as oldFunction };
```

The `export { ... as ... }` syntax can be used to export the same symbol several times, under different names, as seen above. To answer the question from the previous section, you can export a value as `default`:

```js
// These two samples are equivalent:
// 1. Prefixing the declaration with `export default`
export default function greet(name) {
  console.log("Hello " + name);
}

// 2. Using a named export
function greet(name) {
  console.log("Hello " + name);
}
export { greet as default };
```

### Renaming imports

Imports can be renamed as well, with a perfectly symmetrical syntax: `import { ... as ... }`.

```js
// ./jquery.js
export function jQuery(selector) {
  // jQuery magic here ðŸª„âœ¨
}

// ./index.js
import { jQuery as $ } from "./jquery.js";
$("article").toggle();
// `jQuery` is not defined, but `$` is
```

This is useful to avoid conflicts when importing a symbol with the same name as a local variable:

```js
// Rename as `nativeFetch` not to conflict with the local `fetch`
import { fetch as nativeFetch } from "node-fetch";

export function fetch(...options) {
  // Custom fetch implementation wrapping nativeFetch
  return nativeFetch(...options);
}
```

In the same fashion as `export { ... as default }`, we can use `import { default as ... }` to import a default export under a different name:

```js
// These two samples are equivalent:
// 1. Using the import default syntax
import greet from "./greet.js";

// 2. Using a named import
import { default as greet } from "./greet.js";
```

If you are wondering what happens when you import a module with a default export with a namespace import, here is the answer:

```js
// ./config.js
export const host = "localhost";
export const port = 3000;
export default `${host}:${port}`;

// ./index.js
import * as config from "./config.js";
console.log(config);
```

This would print:

```jsonc
{
  // The default export is available under the `default` property:
  "default": "localhost:3000",
  "host": "localhost",
  "port": 3000,
}
```

I hope this clears up the confusion a bit, but just in case here is a quick summary:

<Callout icon="arrow">

`export default <name>` and `import <name>` is syntactic sugar for `export { <name> as default }` and `import { default as <name> }`. They are (mostly) interchangeable.

</Callout>

As `default` is a reserved keyword, you cannot use it to name a variable or a function.

```js
// Does not work
export function default() {
  console.log("Hello");
}
// SyntaxError: function statement requires a name

// Works
function greet() {
  console.log("Hello");
}
export default greet;
```

### Bare imports and side effects

When a module is imported, its code is executed. When a module only exports values, it is called a **pure module**. Otherwise, it is a **module with side-effects**.

```js
// ./side-effects.js
console.log("I'm a side effect!");

// ./index.js
import "./side-effects.js";
console.log("I'm the main module!");
```

When you run `index.js`, you'll see:

```
I'm a side effect!
I'm the main module!
```

An import statement used only for its side effects is called a **bare import**. It will not import any value, but execute the module's code. A bare import can also be written as `import {} from "./side-effects.js"`.

<Callout>

A module should be either pure or have side effects, but not both. Mixing the two is a bad practice, as it makes the module harder to reason about.

</Callout>

## TypeScript imports

We should be done for all possible JavaScript imports, but TypeScript adds some more that we will cover in this section. The first thing to note is that they can only be found in TypeScript files, as they are erased during the transpilation process---the transformation of TypeScript to JavaScript.

### Exporting types

When you want your types to be accessible from other files, you can use the `export` keyword when declaring the type, just as you would with values:

```ts
// ./book.ts
export interface Book {
  title: string;
  year: number;
}
export type Input = string | Book;
export function getTitle(input: Input): string {
  return typeof input === "string" ? input : input.title;
}
```

When transpiled to JavaScript, the resulting code would be:

```js
// ./book.js
export function getTitle(input) {
  return typeof input === "string" ? input : input.title;
}
// interfaces and types are erased
```

As with common exports, TypeScript supports renaming exports, as well as exporting a type as a default export. The only nuance is that the statement starts with `export type`:

```ts
interface InternalBook {
  title: string;
  year: number;
}
export type { InternalBook as Book };
```

This is called a **type-only export**, and it gets erased during the transpilation process. You may also mix type and value exports in the same statement:

```ts
const name = "World";
type Name = string;
export { name, type Name }; // name is a value, Name is a type
```

You might be wondering what the difference is between `export type { ... }` and `export { type ... }`... There's one, small, subtle difference:

```ts
// Type-only export:
export type { Book };
// is removed during transpilation

// Mixed export:
export { type Book };
// get transpiled to:
export {};
```

This is especially important when it comes to imports, which, happy coincidence, is the next section.

<Callout>

You may find `export {Â Thing }` where `Thing` is a type in some codebases. This is a bad practice, as not all tools will understand it. Always use `export type {Â Thing }` for type-only exports.

</Callout>

### Importing types

This is works in pure symmetry with exporting types. You can import a type from another file with the `import` keyword:

```ts
// ./book.ts
export interface Book {
  title: string;
  year: number;
}
export const books: Book[] = [
  { title: "Journey to the Center of the Earth", year: 1864 },
  { title: "Gilded Needles", year: 1980 },
  { title: "The Housemaid", year: 2022 },
];

// ./index.ts
import { books, type Book } from "./book.ts";
// value ^^^^^  ^^^^^^^^^ type

function printBook({ title, year }: Book) {
  console.log(title, "|", year);
}

for (const book of books) {
  printBook(book);
}
```

You also have the possibility to do a type-only import, with the `import type` syntax. Let's explore the nuance between a type-only import and a mixed import:

```ts
// ./book.ts
export interface Book {
  title: string;
  year: number;
}
console.log("I am a side effect!");

// ./index1.ts
import type { Book } from "./book.ts";
//     ^^^^ Type-only import
const book: Book = { title: "Empire of the Ants", year: 1991 };
// No side effect is executed

// ./index2.ts
import { type Book } from "./book.ts";
//       ^^^^ Mixed import
const book: Book = { title: "Empire of the Ants", year: 1991 };
// Prints "I am a side effect!"
```

If you're not sure to understand what's happening, here is the resulting JavaScript code after transpilation:

```js
// ./book.js
console.log("I am a side effect!");

// ./index1.js
const book = { title: "Empire of the Ants", year: 1991 };

// ./index2.js
import {} from "./book.js";
//     ^^ The type import is erased, the import statement is kept,
//        making it a bare import
const book = { title: "Empire of the Ants", year: 1991 };
```

I hope this was clear, but if it was not, please [write a comment](#comments) below and I'll do my best to clarify.

#### Importing JSDoc types

One last thing about type imports: when using JSDoc to type your JavaScript code, you can import types in JSDoc annotations using an `import()` expression:

```js
// ./book.js
/**
 * @typedef {Object} Book
 * @property {string} title
 * @property {number} year
 */

// ./index.js
/** @type {import("./book.js").Book} */
const book = { title: "The Priory of the Orange Tree", year: 2019 };
```

As it can get quite verbose for long paths, TypeScript supports an `@import` JSDoc statement to import types:

```js
// ./index.js
/** @import {Book} from "./book.js" */
/** @type {Book} */
const book = { title: "The Priory of the Orange Tree", year: 2019 };
```

I'd recommend writing TypeScript over JSDoc for most projects, but I mention it here for the sake of completeness---once again.

### Importing values as types

This is about to get a bit more confusing, sorry in advance, but bear with me. You can import a value as a type, if it is meant to be used as a type only:

```ts
// ./book.ts
export class Book {
  title: string;
  year: number;
}

// ./index.ts
import type { Book } from "./book.ts";
//            ^^^^ Never instantiated, only used as a type
function printBook(book: Book) {
  console.log(book.title, "|", book.year);
}
```

In this example, `Book` is a class, not a type. However, in `index.ts`, it's never instantiated, only used for type-checking. This is a common pattern in TypeScript, especially when dealing with classes.

### Overlapping types and values

This might be more advanced than what you ever need to build, but TypeScript allows you to have a type and a value with the same name in the same file:

```ts
// ./compass.ts
export const Compass = {
  North: "n",
  South: "s",
  East: "e",
  West: "w",
} as const;
export type Compass = (typeof Compass)[keyof typeof Compass]; // "n" | "s" | "e" | "w"

// ./index.ts
import { Compass } from "./compass.ts"; // Import both the type and the value

const direction: Compass = Compass.North;
// used as a type ^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^ used as a value
console.log(direction); // Prints "n"
```

I won't elaborate on this, but what's worth remembering is that TypeScript will use the context to determine if `Compass` is a type or a value.

## Dynamic imports

There's one key difference between `import` statements and `require` calls: the former is static, the latter is dynamic. Practically, it means that you cannot use a variable as an argument to an `import` statement:

```js
const file = './config.js';
const config = require(file); // This works
import config from file;      // This does not
```

If you ever need to import a module that is determined at runtime, you can use the `import()` function. It returns a promise containing the module's exports:

```js
// ./config.js
export const host = "localhost";
export const port = 8080; // Custom port!

// ./cli.js
const defaultConfig = { host: "localhost", port: 3000 };

/**
 * Loads the config from a file if specified, falls back to `defaultConfig`
 * otherwise.
 */
function loadConfig() {
  if (process.argv.length >= 3) {
    // If the command line has an argument, import the file
    return import(process.argv[2]);
  }

  return defaultConfig;
}

const config = await loadConfig();
//             ^^^^^ loadConfig returns a promise
console.log("Server running on", config.host + ":" + config.port);
```

When you run `cli.js` with `node cli.js ./config.js`, it will print `Server running on localhost:8080`, dynamically importing the `config.js` file.

Behavior-wise, `const thing = import(...)` is equivalent to `import * as thing from ...`. This means that the default export is available under the `default` property and named exports are available under their respective names:

```js
// ./config.js
export const host = "localhost";
export const port = 3000;
export default `${host}:${port}`;

// ./index.js
const config = await import("./config.js");
console.log(config);
```

This would print:

```jsonc
{
  // The default export is available under the `default` property:
  "default": "localhost:3000",
  "host": "localhost",
  "port": 3000,
}
```

If this rings a bell, it's because I used the same example as [Renaming imports](#renaming-imports). If it does not, you might need to read this article a second time... ðŸ‘€

### `import.meta`

Another runtime feature of ESM is the `import.meta` object. It contains metadata about the current module, as well as resolution primitives:

```js
import.meta.url; // The URL of the current module
// It will look like `file:///path/to/module.js` locally,
// or `https://example.com/module.js` in a browser.

import.meta.resolve("./file.js");
// Resolves the path to `file.js`, relative to the current module,
// as `import('./file.js')` would do, but returns the path as a string
// instead of importing the module.
```

Your runtime might provide additional properties on `import.meta`, you should check the documentation of your runtime for more information.

## Altering the import resolution

If you thought we were done here, oh boy, there's more. We will now explore platform-specific ways to alter the import resolution, starting with Node.js.

### `package.json` definitions

- package.json imports
- package.json exports

### `<script type="importmap">`

- importmap

### Import attributes

<Callout icon="arrow">

You might know this feature under its former name, "import assertions". It is now named import attributes, and the syntax changed `assert` to `with`.

</Callout>

## Good practices
