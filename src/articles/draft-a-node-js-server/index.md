title: How come there are still no good Node.js servers?
---

There are a lot of Node.js servers:

- express
- koa
- hapi
- restify
- polka
- fets
- h3

But they have at least one of the following problems:

- URLPattern
- Support std Request/Response
- Async middlewares
- HTTP Errors
- Auto doc
- Zod validation
