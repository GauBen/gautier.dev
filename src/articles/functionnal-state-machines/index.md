Finite state machines, sometimes simply automatons, are a mathematical model of computation. They are used to describe the behavior of systems, and are often used in computer science to model programs.

I spent a lot of times thinking about automatons because they have an inherent elegance that I admire. This article describes a functional approach to state machines in JavaScript, but you might also be interested in [an imperative approach](./imperative-state-machines).

## Finite-State Automatons

To begin with, let's try to create a simple application that follows this automaton:

<Mermaid>
  graph LR
    A((1))
    B((2))
    C((3))
    A --> B --> C --> A
    style A fill:gold,stroke:black,stroke-width:2px,color:black
    style B fill:firebrick,stroke:black,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff
    style C fill:navy,stroke:black,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff
</Mermaid>

There are three **states** (1, 2 and 3), and three **transitions** (1 â†’ 2, 2 â†’ 3, 3 â†’ 1).

The states can be represented as a set of functions, one for each state:

```ts
let color: string
let label: string

const gold = () => {
  color = 'gold'
  label = 'Magic âœ¨'
}
const red = () => {
  color = 'firebrick'
  label = 'Magic ðŸš’'
}
const blue = () => {
  color = 'navy'
  label = 'Magic ðŸš“'
}

// Set color and label to the initial state
gold()
```

For the transitions, we will take a declarative approach and use a data structure to describe them:

```ts
const automaton = {
  // Initial state
  state: 'gold',
  states: {
    // Describe each state
    gold: {
      // Refer to the `gold` function defined above
      enter: gold,
      // The next state to transition to
      next: 'red',
    },
    red: {
      enter: red,
      next: 'blue',
    },
    blue: {
      enter: blue,
      next: 'gold',
    },
  },
}
```

How do we run this automaton? We need a function that takes an automaton and returns a new automaton. (Note that we are not mutating the automaton, but returning a new one, which is a functional approach.)

```ts
const next = (automaton) => {
  // Get the current state
  const state = automaton.states[automaton.state]

  // Run the next state's `enter` function
  const { enter } = automaton.states[state.next]
  enter()

  // Return a new automaton with the next state
  return {
    state: state.next,
    states: automaton.states,
  }
}
```

And that's all we need for the automaton to run! We can now run our `next` function in a click handler, and this is what we get:

<Automaton />
