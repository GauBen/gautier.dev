    <em>Full-Stack & Cybersecurity Web Engineer</em>
    I started learning programming on my own when I was 10 years old and I now have
    a dual degree in cyber security and digital science. I have extensive experience
    in all areas of IT: architecture, development and maintenance. Today, I work
    at Escape, an API security startup, as a security researcher, software architect,
    developer and designer. I led two major migrations there: the refactoring of
    the GraphQL API from NestJS to Pothos and the overhaul of the frontend from Nuxt
    to SvelteKit.
